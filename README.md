# Workshops of the course *Asset Management* - Evry University

This *repo* is dedicated to the 3 workshops of my course *Asset Management* for the Master *Gestion des Risques et des Actifs* at Evry University.

First of all, see [AFG key figures](https://www.afg.asso.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ficheafgindustry-eng-230911web.pdf) for the French AM industry.

Before each workshop, the results will be disclosed on real data with only some R codes: only files .md will be at disposal and not source files .Rmd. 

The 4th workshop will be dedicated to R Markdown and its use to create the report for the course: see [this book chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) for more precisions on R Markdown.

Before the first workshop, each student has to follow these 4 steps:

1. download R base from [R project](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (step 1 of the web link),
2. download RStudio from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (step 2 of the web link),
3. download the packages __tidyverse__, __readxl__, __DataExplorer__, __scales__ with the function `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readxl", "DataExplorer", "scales", "corrplot"))`,
4. _(optional)_ download [Excel add-in](https://www.quandl.com/tools/excel) of Quandl.
